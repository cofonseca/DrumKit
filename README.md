# What Is This?
This is a very simple web application that allows a user to create music by using their computer's keyboard to play a variety of sounds. The idea for the app came from the Javascript30 video series, and is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This app was built solely to help me learn Javascript, and has no real purpose aside from that.

A live demo can be found on Heroku: https://javascript30-drumkit.herokuapp.com/

# Any Future Plans?
Glad you asked! 

*Eventually*, I'd like to expand upon this by adding additional sound effects, and granting a user the ability to select a sound and map it to any available key on their keyboard themselves.
